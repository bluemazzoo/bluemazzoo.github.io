I put this site together to serve as a personal page, as well as a way to practice and learn how to build things online. If something on here isn't working, there's a good chance I'm still figuring it out. However, in case I missed it, please open an issue in my <a href="https://github.com/bluemazzoo/bluemazzoo.github.io">GitHub account</a>. Thanks!</p>

<h3 id="how-i-built-this-site">How I Built This Site</h3>

<p>As I mentioned above, this site will always be a work in progress, as I continue to learn more about programming. However, there are a few resources that I looked to at the beginning. Here they are, in no particular order:</p>

          <ul class="developer-resources">

            <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-course-2/">Rob Percival's Udemy Course</a> - This course taught me the basics about bootstrap and where to find lots of other resources.</li>

            <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> - I started this course after I'd built the page, but it helped me figure out the CSS to create the dislcaimer box at the bottom of each page, as well as understand some of the CSS basics that I wasn't too familiar with.</li>
            
            <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">Khan Academy's Intro to HTML/CSS</a> - This course taught me the basics about HTML and CSS, which is foundational for any understanding of programming. It also teaches you some of the basics about how the tools you'll need to use throughout the process of building a website.</li>

            <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python">Coursera's Python for Everybody course</a> - This course goes through a more complex language, python, but explains a lot about how to run programs on your computer. It's not necessary to make a website, but you'll learn a ton</li>

            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools website</a> - This website contains more documentation about programming than you'll need to get a website going, but it's a great resource if you forget how to do anything.</li>

            <li><a href="http://www.ben.balter.com/">Ben Balter's website</a> - Ben's put together a great personal website that is way more complicated than what I've been able to put together. However, it makes use of bootstrap and is a great resource if you want to view the source and see how he put together some of the pages and posts.</li>

            <li><a href="https://www.chenhuijing.com/blog/setting-up-custom-domain-github-pages/">Adding custom domain</a> - It took me a little time to figure this out, but this website has a great walkthrough of how to add a custom domain to a GitHub Pages site.</li>

            <li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/#configuring-an-alias-or-aname-record-with-your-dns-provider">Adding an Aname record to the domain</a> - I had no idea what an Aname record was until I had to put one in place. Basically, after I set up the CNAME record, I tried to search this website without the "www" in front of it, but couldn't get through. Then, I did some googling, and found out about <a href="https://my.bluehost.com/cgi/help/whats-an-a-record">apex records</a>. For a fluid user experience, make sure you add that to your DNS records.</li>
